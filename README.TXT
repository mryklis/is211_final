For my final project I created a blogging application.

The application was developed in Python 3.6

I used a css template from W3schools.com, but saved it so that it is loaded from the site's local path.

The version uploaded here and to http://mryklis.pythonanywhere.com/ work in Internet Explorer. 
Chrome and Firefox produces error's on POST requests. (something I will need to address at a later time)

The db was created ahead of time using the schema.sql and test data populated.
The index page shows a listing of posts, in descending order (newest post on top), 
with only the first 200 characters of the post displayed in the frame.

Clicking 'READ MORE' will take you to a permalink where you could read the entire post.

You could login to the application with U:maxim P:password

The Dashboard has option to delete individual posts, edit individual posts, and create a new post.
